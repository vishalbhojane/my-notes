Virtual DOM is a  lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM
Used by React for efficient rendering and updates

## Why Virtual DOM?
- Improves performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulation
- Enables faster updates and rendering

## How It Works

### Initial Render:
1. React creates a virtual DOM tree
2. Renders the actual DOM based on this virtual tree

### On State or Prop Changes:
1. New virtual DOM tree is created
2. React compares new and old virtual DOMs (diffing)
3. Identifies minimal necessary changes
4. Updates only changed parts in real DOM (reconciliation)

## Benefits:
- Efficient updates and better performance
- Cross-platform development capabilities
- Simplified programming model for developers

## Virtual DOM vs. Real DOM:
| Virtual DOM | Real DOM |
|-------------|----------|
| Faster to create and manipulate | More expensive to manipulate |
| Allows batched updates | Direct updates |

## Key Concepts:
- DOM (Document Object Model): Browser's HTML element representation
- Virtual DOM: React's lightweight DOM copy
- Diffing: Process of comparing virtual DOMs
- Reconciliation: Updating real DOM based on virtual DOM differences
