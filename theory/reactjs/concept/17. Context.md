Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

- Solves the problem of prop drilling
- Allows data sharing across multiple components
- Useful for global themes, user data, or any widely-used data

## How to Use Context

1. Create the context:

```jsx
const AppContext = createContext();
```

2. Wrap provider component and set value:

```jsx
<AppContext.Provider value={'My App'}>
    <App/>
</AppContext.Provider>
```

3. Use data with useContext hook:

```jsx
function Title() {
    const text = useContext(AppContext);
    return <h1>{text}</h1>
}
```

## Benefits:

- Simplifies data passing in deeply nested component trees
- Reduces prop drilling
- Makes component reusability easier

## Best Practices:

- Use Context for data that is truly global or needed by many components
- Don't overuse Context; it can make component reuse more difficult
- Consider performance implications for frequently changing data
