StrictMode is a special React component designed to highlight potential problems in an application during development.

- Development tool only; does not affect production build
- Helps identify and fix common issues early
- Encourages use of recommended practices

## Purpose of StrictMode

- Identifies unsafe lifecycles and deprecated APIs
- Warns about unexpected side effects
- Ensures better adherence to React best practices

## How to Implement

```jsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react';

<StrictMode>
    <App />
</StrictMode>
```

## Additional Benefits:

- Double-invokes certain lifecycle methods to help detect side effects
- Verifies that components can handle being unmounted and remounted
- Helps identify issues with legacy context API usage
