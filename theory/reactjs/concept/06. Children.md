Children props allow components to pass other components or elements as props.

- Enables component composition
- Useful for creating layout components
- Accessed via `props.children`

## Passing Children

```jsx
<Parent>
    <Child/> {/* Passed as children */}
</Parent>
```

## Accessing Children

```jsx
function Parent(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            {props.children}
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Use Case: Layout Components

Children props are great for creating reusable layout components:

```jsx
<Layout> {/* Contains common elements like Header, Footer */}
    {/* Children content is inserted here */}
</Layout>
```
