An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or completing a task.
The effectiveness of an algorithm depends on factors like computational complexity, memory usage, scalability, optimality, etc
Algorithm design involves balancing trade-offs between simplicity, performance, maintainability, and other considerations, based on the specific needs of the application at hand

### Bruce force
Simple and exhaustive technique that evaluates every possible outcome to find the best solution.
Ex: Linear search

### Greedy
Choose the best option at the current time, without any consideration for the future.
Ex: Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm

### Divide and Conquer
Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems.
Each sub-problem is then solved and the partial solutions are recombined to determine the overall solution.
Ex: Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort and Tower of Hanoi

### Dynamic Programming
Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems.
Break it down into smaller but overlapping sub problems.
Store the result and reuse it for the same sub-problems. This is called memoization and is a optimization technique that improves the time complexity of your algorithm.
Ex: Fibonacci numbers and climbing staircase

### Backtracking
Generate all possible solutions.
Check if the solution satisfies all the given constrains and only then you proceed with generating subsequent solutions.
If the constraints are not satisfied, backtrack and go on a different path to find the solution.
Ex: N-Queens problem
