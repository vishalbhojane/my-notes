Asynchronous JavaScript enables non-blocking execution of tasks, allowing:
- Concurrent operations
- Improved responsiveness
- Efficient handling of time-consuming operations in web applications

## JavaScript's Nature

JavaScript is fundamentally:
- Single-threaded
- Synchronous (code executes in order, one line at a time)

However, JavaScript can appear asynchronous in certain situations.

## Methods for Asynchronous Tasks

1. Callbacks
2. Promises
3. Async/Await (built on Promises)

## Examples of Asynchronous JavaScript

### setTimeout

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This runs after 1 second");
}, 1000);
```

### Event Listeners

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("#asy");
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Button clicked");
});
```
