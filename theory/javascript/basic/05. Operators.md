Operators are used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations
### Assignment (`=`)
Assigns value to the left variable

```js
let x = 10;
```

```js
x += y;
x = x + y;
```

Similar for other arithmetic operators i.e. `-=`,` *=`,` /=`, `%=`

---
### Nullish Coalescing (`??`)
If the first value is `undefined` or `null`, the second value is assigned (ES2020 feature)

```js
let x;
x ??= 5;
```

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
```

---
### Arithmetic
Perform mathematical operations

Addition

```js
x + y;
"vishal" + " " + "bhojane";
```

Subtraction

```js
x - y
```

Multiplication

```js
x * y
```

Division

```js
x / y
```

Modulus - returns the division remainder

```js
x % 2
```

Incrementing

```js
x++
```

Pre-incrementing

```js
++x
```

Decrementing

```js
x--
```

Pre-decrementing

```js
--x
```

Exponentiation

```js
x ** 3 // cube of x
```
