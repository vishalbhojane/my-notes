Variables are used to store the data

declare a variable

```js
var a;
```

declare and initialize a variable

```js
var a = 1;
```

re-assign a variable

```js
a = 2;
```

ES6 introduced two new ways to declare variables

```js
let
let b = 1

```
`let` can be reassigned a value

```js
b = 2
```

```js
const
const c = 1
```

`const` cannot be reassigned

```js
c = 2
// TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```
