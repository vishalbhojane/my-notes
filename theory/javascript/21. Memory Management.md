Memory management in JavaScript is handled automatically by the runtime environment (e.g., browser's JavaScript engine or `Node.js`).
## Key Points:
- Uses garbage collection for automatic memory management
- Developers don't need to manually allocate or deallocate memory

## Memory Life Cycle:
1. Allocation of required memory
2. Usage of allocated memory
3. Release of memory when no longer needed

## Memory Storage Areas
### Stack
- Stores static data (size known at compile time)
- Contains: - Primitive values (strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined)
- References to objects and functions
- Uses static memory allocation
### Heap
- Stores objects and functions
- Dynamic allocation (no fixed size)
- Allocates space as required
## Comparison:

Stack vs Heap

| Feature | Stack | Heap |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content | Primitives and references | Objects and functions |
| Size determination | Compile time | Run time |
| Memory allocation | Fixed | Dynamic (no preset limit) |

## Garbage Collection (GC)

Garbage Collection is an automatic memory management system that handles the release of unused memory.

## How Garbage Collection Works:

1. **Reference Counting:**
- Counts references to each object
- Frees memory when reference count reaches zero
- Limitation: Can't handle circular references

```javascript
let obj = { a: 1 }; // Reference count: 1
   let anotherRef = obj; // Reference count: 2
   obj = null; // Reference count: 1
   anotherRef = null; // Reference count: 0, object can be garbage collected
```

2. **Mark and Sweep Algorithm:**
- Marks all reachable objects from root
- Sweeps and frees unmarked (unreachable) objects
- Handles circular references

```javascript
function createCycle() {
     let obj1 = {};
     let obj2 = {};
     obj1.a = obj2; // obj1 references obj2
     obj2.a = obj1; // obj2 references obj1
   }
   createCycle();
   // After function execution, obj1 and obj2 are unreachable and can be garbage collected
```

## Best Practices:

1. Avoid global variables
2. Nullify references to large objects when no longer needed
3. Be cautious with closures that can retain references

```javascript
function potentialMemoryLeak() {
  let largeData = new Array(1000000);
  return function() {
    console.log(largeData[0]);
  }
}
let leak = potentialMemoryLeak(); // largeData is retained in closure
leak = null; // Allow garbage collection
```
