## Callback Queue

- Stores functions passed as arguments to asynchronous functions (e.g., `setTimeout()`)
- Functions are executed only after the Call Stack is empty (all synchronous functions have finished)
## Microtask Queue

- Stores asynchronous operations requiring immediate execution compared to regular callback functions
- Typically used for Promises and Mutation Observers
## Comparison 
| Feature | Callback Queue | Microtask Queue | 
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Content | Callbacks from `setTimeout()` and similar APIs | Callbacks from Promises and Mutation Observers | 
| Priority | Lower | Higher | 
| Execution Timing | After Call Stack is empty | Immediately after current task, before rendering |
