## Primitive Data Types
### String
Represents textual data.

```javascript
let str = "hello";
let emptyStr = "";
```

### Number
Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

```javascript
let num1 = 1;
let num2 = 3.14;
```

### Boolean
Represents a logical entity with two values: `true` or `false`.

```javascript
let bool1 = true;
let bool2 = false;
```

### Undefined
Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

```javascript
let myVar1 = undefined;
let myVar2;
console.log(myVar2);
// Output: undefined
```

### Null
Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

```javascript
let response = null;
```

## Reference Data Types
### Array
Used to store and organize multiple values within a single variable.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6];
```

### Object
Used to store multiple values in key-value pairs.

```javascript
let person = {
  name: 'Vishal',
  id: 1
};
```

## Checking Data Types
The `typeof` operator returns the data type of a JavaScript variable.

```javascript
console.log(typeof 1);
// Output: number

console.log(typeof {});
// Output: object

console.log(typeof []);
// Output: object (Note: Arrays are considered objects in JavaScript)
```

Additional Notes:
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can hold different types of data at different times.
- The `BigInt` type is available in modern JavaScript for representing integers larger than 2^53 - 1.
- The `Symbol` type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.
