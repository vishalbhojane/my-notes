Function composition is the process of combining multiple functions to create a new function, where the output of one function becomes the input of the next.

## Key Concepts:

1. Functions are applied in right-to-left order.
2. The `compose` function takes multiple functions and returns a new function.
3. Composition enhances code reusability, readability, and maintainability.

## Example:

```javascript
const add5 = (x) => x + 5;
const multiplyBy3 = (x) => x * 3;
const subtract10 = (x) => x - 10;

const composedFunction = compose(subtract10, multiplyBy3, add5);
const result = composedFunction(7);
```

## Implementing `compose`:

```javascript
const compose = (...fns) => (input) => 
    fns.reduceRight((acc, curr) => curr(acc), input);
```

## Advantages:

1. **Reusability**: Create complex operations from smaller, focused functions.
2. **Readability**: Express transformations in a declarative, concise manner.
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand, test, and modify individual functions.

## Best Practices:

- Keep composed functions pure (no side effects).
- Use meaningful names for functions to enhance readability.
- Consider using libraries like Ramda or Lodash for advanced composition techniques.
