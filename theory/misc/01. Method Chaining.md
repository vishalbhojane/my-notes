Method chaining is a programming technique that allows multiple methods to be called on the same object in a single statement.

## Key Points:

1. Calls a method on the result of another method of the same object.
2. Improves code readability and reduces the number of lines.
3. Each method in the chain returns `this` (the object itself) to allow further chaining.

## Example:

```javascript
const computeTotalAmount = function() {
    let totalAmount = 0;
    return {
        lacs: function(amount) {
            totalAmount += amount * 100000;
            return this;
        },
        thousand: function(amount) {
            totalAmount += amount * 1000;
            return this;
        },
        crore: function(amount) {
            totalAmount += amount * 10000000;
            return this;
        },
        value: function() {
            return totalAmount;
        }
    };
};

const result = computeTotalAmount().lacs(10).thousand(5).crore(2).value();
console.log(result); // Outputs the total amount
```

## How it works:

1. `computeTotalAmount()` returns an object with methods.
2. Each method (except `value()`) modifies `totalAmount` and returns `this`.
3. The `value()` method returns the final `totalAmount`.
4. Methods can be chained in any order.

## Benefits:

- Cleaner and more intuitive code
- Allows for fluent interfaces
- Reduces the need for temporary variables
