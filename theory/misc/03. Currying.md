Currying is a technique of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.

## Key Concepts:

1. Converts a function of `n` arguments into `n` functions of one argument each.
2. Allows partial application of a function's arguments.
3. Can be implemented using `bind()` or closures.

## Examples:

### Normal Function:

```javascript
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
const multiplyByTwo = (y) => 2 * y;
```

### Currying using `bind()`:

```javascript
const multiplyByTwo_Bind = multiply.bind(null, 2);
multiplyByTwo_Bind(3); // Returns 6
```

### Currying using Closures:

```javascript
const multiplyNew = (x) => (y) => x * y;
const multiplyByTwo_Closure = multiplyNew(2);
multiplyByTwo_Closure(3); // Returns 6
```

## Advantages:

1. **Flexibility**: Create specialized functions from more general ones.
2. **Partial Application**: Apply some arguments now and the rest later.
3. **Composition**: Easily combine curried functions.

## Best Practices:

- Use currying for functions that are frequently called with the same initial arguments.
- Consider using libraries like Ramda or Lodash for advanced currying techniques.
- Be mindful of potential performance implications with excessive currying.
