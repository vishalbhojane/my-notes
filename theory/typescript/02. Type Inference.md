TypeScript infers types based on the value assigned to a variable at the time of declaration.

```typescript
let num = 10; // inferred as number
let message = "Hello"; // inferred as string
let nums = [1, 2, 3]; // inferred as number[]
```

This reduces the need for explicit type annotations in many cases.
