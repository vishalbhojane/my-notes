Interfaces define the structure of an object, including its properties and methods.

```typescript
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

let person: Person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30
};

interface Employee extends Person {
    employeeId: number;
}

let employee: Employee = {
    name: "Jane",
    age: 28,
    employeeId: 123
};
```
