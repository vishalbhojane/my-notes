### Question: What are some advantages/disadvantages to testing your code?
Answer:
Advantages:
- Catches bugs early in development
- Improves code quality and reliability
- Serves as documentation for code behavior
- Facilitates refactoring and maintenance
- Increases confidence in code changes

Disadvantages:
- Requires additional time and effort upfront
- May slow down initial development process
- Can give false sense of security if not done properly
- Requires maintenance as code evolves

### Question: What tools would you use to test your code's functionality?
Answer: Common testing tools include:
- Jest for JavaScript unit and integration testing
- Mocha and Chai for JavaScript testing
- Selenium for browser automation and end-to-end testing
- Cypress for modern web application testing
- PyTest for Python testing
- JUnit for Java testing
- Postman for API testing

### Question: What is the difference between a unit test and a functional/integration test?
Answer:
Unit tests:
- Test individual components or functions in isolation
- Quick to run and easy to write
- Help identify specific issues in code logic

Functional/Integration tests:
- Test how different parts of the system work together
- Verify that the application meets business requirements
- Often involve testing through the UI or API
- Take longer to run and are more complex to set up

### Question: What is the purpose of a code style linting tool?
Answer: A code style linting tool:
- Enforces consistent coding style across a project
- Identifies potential errors or bad practices
- Improves code readability and maintainability
- Helps catch syntax errors before runtime
- Can automatically fix some style issues

Examples include ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python, and RuboCop for Ruby.

### Question: What are some of the testing best practices?
Answer:
1. Write tests before or alongside code (Test-Driven Development)
2. Keep tests simple, readable, and maintainable
3. Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
4. Aim for high test coverage, but focus on critical paths
5. Use mocks and stubs to isolate units being tested
6. Run tests frequently, ideally in an automated CI/CD pipeline
7. Regularly refactor tests along with the code
8. Test both positive scenarios and edge cases
9. Avoid testing implementation details, focus on behavior
10. Maintain independence between tests to prevent cascading failures

These practices help ensure effective and efficient testing processes.
