Error

```bash
nvm is not compatible with the "PREFIX" environment variable: currently set to "/opt/homebrew" Run `unset PREFIX` to unset it. vishalbhojane@vishal-bhojane ~ % /Users/vishalbhojane/Documents/G24/ludolobbyfe/node_modules/react-native/scripts/launchPackager.command ; exit;
```

1. First, unset the PREFIX variable:

```text
unset PREFIX
```

2. Now, let's check if the PREFIX variable is still set:

```text
echo $PREFIX
```

If this doesn't output anything, the PREFIX variable has been successfully unset.

3. Next, let's ensure that NVM is properly set up. Add these lines to your ~/.zshrc file if they're not already there:

```text
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

4. Reload your shell configuration:

```text
source ~/.zshrc
```

5. Verify that NVM is working:

```text
command -v nvm
```

This should output "nvm" if NVM is properly installed and loaded.

6. List installed Node.js versions:

```text
nvm ls
```

7. If you don't see any versions listed, install Node.js using NVM:

```text
nvm install node  # This installs the latest version
```

8. Use the installed Node.js version:

```text
nvm use node
```

9. Now, try running your React Native packager again:

```text
/Users/vishalbhojane/Documents/G24/ludolobbyfe/node_modules/react-native/scripts/launchPackager.command
```
