GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them
A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common prime factors

```
36 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3
60 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 5

GCD = Multiplication of common factors
	= 2 x 2 x 3
	= 12
```

### Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD
If we subtract a smaller number from a larger one (we reduce a larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD

```js
/**
 * Iterative version of Euclidean Algorithm of finding greatest common divisor (GCD).
 * @param {number} originalA
 * @param {number} originalB
 * @return {number}
 */
 
 function euclideanAlgorithmIterative(originalA, originalB) {
  // Make input numbers positive.
  let a = Math.abs(originalA);
  let b = Math.abs(originalB);

  // Subtract one number from another until both numbers would become the same.
  // This will be out GCD. Also quit the loop if one of the numbers is zero.
  while (a && b && a !== b) {
    [a, b] = a > b ? [a - b, b] : [a, b - a];
  }

  // Return the number that is not equal to zero since the last subtraction (it will be a GCD).
  return a || b;
}
```

### With Recursion
Now instead of subtraction, if we divide the larger number, the algorithm stops when we find the remainder 0

```js
/**
 * Recursive version of Euclidean Algorithm of finding greatest common divisor (GCD).
 * @param {number} originalA
 * @param {number} originalB
 * @return {number}
 */
function euclideanAlgorithm(originalA, originalB) {
  // Make input numbers positive.
  const a = Math.abs(originalA);
  const b = Math.abs(originalB);

  // To make algorithm work faster instead of subtracting one number from the other
  // we may use modulo operation.
  return (b === 0) ? a : euclideanAlgorithm(b, a % b);
}
```
