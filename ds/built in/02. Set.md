A set is a data structure that can hold a collection of values. The values however must be **unique**

Set can contain a mix of different data types.
You can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same set

Sets are dynamically sized. You don't have to declare the size of a set before creating it
Sets do not maintain an insertion order

Sets are iterable. They can be used with a for of loop

---

Create a set

```js
const set = new Set([1,2,3])
```

Add new value

```js
set.add(4)

// if u add duplicate value, set will ignore
set.add(4)
```

Check if the value exist

```js
set.has(4)
```

Delete the value

```js
set.delete(4)
```

Delete all the values

```js
set.clear()
```

Size of the set

```js
set.size
```

Loop over

```js
for(const item of set){
    console.log(item)
}
```

### Set vs Array

Arrays can contain duplicate values whereas Sets cannot
Insertion order is maintained in arrays but it is not the case with sets
Searching and deleting an element in the set is faster compared to arrays
