### What is a data structure?
A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently
A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data

### Why learn data structures?
Almost every application we build involves data that is modelled in a certain way
To efficiently manage that data, you need data structures
Imagine walking into a library only to find out there is no efficient organization of the books and they are stored randomly

The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds vs a few seconds or even minutes comes down to the selection of the right data structure  
Data structures help you solve problems in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory 

Learning about data structures also help you gain a more profound understanding of things you're already aware of  
DOM - Tree data structure  
Browser back and forward - Stack data structure  
OS job scheduling - Queue data structure
