You have a linked list where each node represents a binary digit (0 or 1). The goal of the `binaryToDecimal` function is to convert this binary number, represented by the linked list, into its decimal equivalent.

How Binary to Decimal Conversion Works:
In binary-to-decimal conversion, each position of a binary number corresponds to a specific power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit.
- The rightmost digit is multiplied by 2^0 (which equals 1).
- The next digit to the left is multiplied by 2^1 (which equals 2).
- The digit after that is multiplied by 2^2 (which equals 4)..and so on.

To find the decimal representation:
1. Multiply each binary digit by its corresponding power of 2 value. 
2. Sum up all these products.
 
Example Execution with Binary `101`:
1. Start with `num = 0`.
2. Process `1` (from the head of the linked list): `num = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1`
3. Process `0`: `num = 1 * 2 + 0 = 2`
4. Process `1`: `num = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5`
5. Return `num`, which is `5`.

Steps Involved in the Function:
1. A variable `num` is initialized to 0, which will store our computed decimal number.
2. Starting from the head of the linked list (the leftmost binary digit), iterate through each node until the end.
3. For every node, double the current value of `num` (this is analogous to shifting in binary representation). Then, add the binary digit of the current node.
4. Move to the next node and repeat until you've visited all nodes.
5. Return the value in `num`, which now represents the decimal value of the binary number in the linked list.

```js
// Define the binaryToDecimal function for the LinkedList class
binaryToDecimal() {
    // Initialize variable 'num' to 0. This will store the final decimal value.
    let num = 0;
 
    // Initialize 'current' to point to the head of the linked list.
    // 'current' will be used to traverse through the list.
    let current = this.head;
 
    // Loop through each node in the linked list until 'current' is null.
    // If 'current' is null, it means we have reached the end of the list.
    while (current !== null) {
        
        // Perform binary to decimal conversion for the current digit.
        // Multiply 'num' by 2 to shift its binary value one place to the left,
        // and add the value of the current node ('current.value').
        // This constructs the binary number in a left-to-right fashion.
        num = num * 2 + current.value;
 
        // Move 'current' to the next node in the list,
        // so that the loop can continue to the next digit.
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    // Return the final decimal value stored in 'num' after
    // converting the entire binary number.
    return num;
}
```

This method converts a binary number represented by the linked list to its decimal equivalent.
Let's break down the code step-by-step:

Step 1: Initialize Variables
1. let num = 0;
2. let current = this.head;
- `num`: This variable will store the decimal representation of the binary number. Initialized to zero.
- `current`: This variable points to the head node of the linked list initially. We'll traverse the list using this pointer.
 
Step 2: Loop Through the Linked List

```js
while (current !== null) {
	num = num * 2 + current.value;
	current = current.next;
}
```

- The `while` loop continues until `current` becomes `null`, meaning we have reached the end of the linked list.
- Inside the loop:
 1. `num = num * 2 + current.value;`: This line does the binary to decimal conversion. Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2. So, we multiply the existing decimal (`num`) by 2 (essentially shifting all bits to the left by 1) and add the binary digit (`current.value`) at the current position in the linked list.
 2. `current = current.next;`: This moves the pointer to the next node in the list.

Step 3: Return the Result
1. return num;
- The final value of `num` is returned, representing the decimal equivalent of the binary number stored in the linked list.
 
Summary
The method traverses the linked list node by node, considering each node value as a binary digit. It constructs the decimal number by doubling the existing decimal and adding the new binary digit, from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). Finally, it returns the decimal number.
