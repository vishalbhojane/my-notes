Implement a member function called `isPalindrome()` that checks if a doubly linked list is a palindrome.  
  
A doubly linked list is a palindrome if the sequence of values read from the head to the tail is the same as the sequence of values read from the tail to the head.

Output:
- Return a boolean value: `true` if the doubly linked list is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

Constraints:
- You can only traverse the doubly linked list once.

Example 1:
Suppose you have a DoublyLinkedList object, list, with the following values:  
1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1  
  After calling the `isPalindrome()` function:
`const result = list.isPalindrome();`
`result` should be `true`, as the doubly linked list is a palindrome.

Example 2:
Now suppose you have a DoublyLinkedList object, list, with the following values:  
3 <-> 1 <-> 2  
After calling the `isPalindrome()` function:
`const result = list.isPalindrome();`
`result` should be `false`, as the doubly linked list is not a palindrome.

```js
isPalindrome() {
  // If the list has 0 or 1 nodes, it's a palindrome
  if (this.length <= 1) return true;

  // Initialize forwardNode at the head and backwardNode at the tail
  let forwardNode = this.head;
  let backwardNode = this.tail;

  // Iterate through half of the list
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor(this.length / 2); i++) {
      // If forwardNode value is not equal to backwardNode value, 
      // it's not a palindrome
      if (forwardNode.value !== backwardNode.value) return false;

      // Move forwardNode to the next node and backwardNode to the previous node
      forwardNode = forwardNode.next;
      backwardNode = backwardNode.prev;
  }

  // If all pairs match, it's a palindrome
  return true;
}
```
##### Explanation
The `isPalindrome()` method determines whether the doubly linked list is a palindrome, meaning the values of the nodes read the same forward and backward.  

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the logic:
1. If the length of the list is less than or equal to 1, return true, as the list is considered a palindrome by default.
2. Initialize two pointers: `forwardNode`, pointing to the head of the doubly linked list, and `backwardNode`, pointing to the tail of the list. These pointers will be used to traverse the list from both ends.
3. Use a for loop to iterate through half of the list, stopping at the middle node. The loop iterates `Math.floor(this.length / 2)` times, which ensures that it covers half of the list, regardless of whether the list has an even or odd number of nodes.
4. Inside the loop, compare the values of the nodes pointed to by `forwardNode` and `backwardNode`. If the values are not equal, return false, as the list is not a palindrome.
5. If the values are equal, update the `forwardNode` pointer to point to the next node, and update the `backwardNode` pointer to point to the previous node. This step allows the loop to continue comparing the node values from both ends of the list.
6. After the loop, return true, as all pairs of nodes have been compared and their values are equal, meaning the list is a palindrome.
