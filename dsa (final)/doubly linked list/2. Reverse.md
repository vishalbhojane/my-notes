Implement a member function called `reverse()` that reverses the nodes of a doubly linked list.

Output:
- The function should modify the doubly linked list in-place, reversing the order of the nodes.
 
Constraints:
- You can only reverse the nodes themselves, not just their values.
 
Example 1:
Suppose you have a DoublyLinkedList object, list, with the following values:
1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5

After calling the `reverse()` function:
`list.reverse();`The doubly linked list should now have the following values:
5 <-> 4 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1

Example 2:
Now suppose you have a DoublyLinkedList object, list, with the following values:
3 <-> 1 <-> 2

After calling the `reverse()` function:
`list.reverse();`The doubly linked list should now have the following values:
2 <-> 1 <-> 3

```js
// Define the 'reverse' method to reverse a doubly linked list.
reverse() {
  // Start at the first node, known as the 'head'.
  let current = this.head;

  // Create a 'temp' variable set to null. 
  // We'll use this to temporarily store data.
  let temp = null;

  // Loop through each node in the list.
  // Continue as long as 'current' is not null.
  while (current !== null) {

    // Store the 'prev' pointer of the current node 
    // into 'temp'. This is like putting it in a safe box.
    temp = current.prev;

    // Now we swap the 'prev' and 'next' pointers. 
    // Make 'prev' point where 'next' was pointing.
    current.prev = current.next;

    // Make 'next' point where 'prev' was originally 
    // pointing, which we stored in 'temp'.
    current.next = temp;

    // Move to the next node in the original list.
    // Remember, 'prev' now holds the original 'next'.
    current = current.prev;
  }

  // We've reversed all the nodes. Now, let's switch the 
  // 'head' and 'tail'.

  // Store the original 'head' into 'temp'.
  temp = this.head;

  // Set the new 'head' to be the original 'tail'.
  this.head = this.tail;

  // Set the new 'tail' to be the original 'head', 
  // which we saved in 'temp'.
  this.tail = temp;
}
```

##### Explanation

The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the nodes in the doubly linked list.  
Here's a step-by-step explanation of the logic:

Variable Initialization
1. `let current = this.head;`:
    - This sets a variable called `current` to point at the very first node in the list. This is our starting point.
2. `let temp = null;`:
    - We also have a variable named `temp`, which we initially set to `null`. We'll use this as a temporary storage space shortly.
        
Loop to Go Through the List
1. `while (current !== null) { ... }`:
    - We have a `while` loop that will run as long as `current` is not `null`. In other words, as long as there's a node to look at, keep going.
        
Inside the Loop
1. `temp = current.prev;`:
    - We store the current node's `prev` pointer in `temp`. We're saving it because we're about to change what `prev` points to, and we don't want to lose this original information.
2. `current.prev = current.next;`:
    - Now, we change the `prev` pointer of the current node to point where its `next` pointer was pointing. This is a key part of the reversal process.
3. `current.next = temp;`:
    - Here, we set the `next` pointer of the current node to what we saved in `temp`. This is the original `prev` value.
4. `current = current.prev;`:
    - Finally, we move to the next node to repeat this process. Note that `current.prev` now holds what was originally in `current.next`, because we swapped them. So this actually moves us forward in the original list, which has now been partially reversed.
        
Swap Head and Tail
1. `temp = this.head;`:
    - After the loop, we need to swap the `head` and `tail` pointers, so we store the original `head` in `temp`.
2. `this.head = this.tail;`:
    - We set the new `head` to be what was originally the `tail`.
3. `this.tail = temp;`:
    - We set the new `tail` to be what was originally the `head`.
