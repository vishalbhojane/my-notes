Implement a member function called `swapPairs()` that swaps every two adjacent nodes of a doubly linked list.  
  
Note: This `DoublyLinkedList` does not have a tail pointer which will make the implementation easier.

Output:
- The function should modify the doubly linked list in-place, swapping every two adjacent nodes.
    
Constraints:
- You can only traverse the doubly linked list once.
    
Example 1:
Suppose you have a `DoublyLinkedList` object, list, with the following values:  
1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5  

After calling the `swapPairs()` function:
`list.swapPairs();`

The doubly linked list should now have the following values:  
2 <-> 1 <-> 4 <-> 3 <-> 5


Example 2:
Now suppose you have a `DoublyLinkedList` object, list, with the following values:  
3 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 4  

After calling the `swapPairs()` function:
`list.swapPairs();`

The doubly linked list should now have the following values:  
1 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 2

```js
swapPairs() {
  // Create a dummy node with value 0
  const dummy = new Node(0);
  // Set dummy's next to head of list
  dummy.next = this.head;
  // Set prev as dummy
  let prev = dummy;

  // Iterate while head and head's next exist
  while (this.head !== null && this.head.next !== null) {
    // Assign first and second nodes
    const firstNode = this.head;
    const secondNode = this.head.next;

    // Update next pointers for swapping
    prev.next = secondNode;
    firstNode.next = secondNode.next;
    secondNode.next = firstNode;

    // Update prev pointers for swapping
    secondNode.prev = prev;
    firstNode.prev = secondNode;
    // Update prev pointer of next node if exists
    if (firstNode.next !== null) {
      firstNode.next.prev = firstNode;
    }

    // Move head and prev pointers forward
    this.head = firstNode.next;
    prev = firstNode;
  }

  // Update head of the list
  this.head = dummy.next;
  // Set prev of new head to null
  if (this.head) this.head.prev = null;
}
```
##### Explanation

The `swapPairs()` method swaps every pair of adjacent nodes in the doubly linked list.  
  
Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. `const dummy = new Node(0);`: A dummy node is created with a value of 0. This dummy node will simplify the manipulation of pointers, especially at the beginning of the list.
    
2. `dummy.next = this.head;`: The dummy node's next pointer is set to the current head of the linked list.
    
3. `let prev = dummy;`: A pointer to a Node object named prev is created and initialized to the dummy node. It will be used to store the reference to the previous node during iteration.
    
4. `while (this.head !== null && this.head.next !== null) { ... }`: This while loop iterates through the linked list as long as the current node (this.head) and its next node are not nullptr, indicating there is at least one pair of nodes left to swap.
    
5. Inside the loop:
    a. `const firstNode = this.head;`: A pointer to the first node in the current pair is created and initialized to the current node (this.head).
    
    b. `const secondNode = this.head.next;`: A pointer to the second node in the current pair is created and initialized to the next node of the current node (this.head).
    
    c. `prev.next = secondNode;`: The previous node's next pointer is updated to point to the second node, essentially swapping the position of the first and second nodes in the pair.
    
    d. `firstNode.next = secondNode.next;`: The first node's next pointer is updated to point to the node after the second node.
    
    e. `secondNode.next = firstNode;`: The second node's next pointer is updated to point to the first node.
    
    f. `secondNode.prev = prev;`: The second node's prev pointer is updated to point to the previous node.
    
    g. `firstNode.prev = secondNode;`: The first node's prev pointer is updated to point to the second node.
    
    h. `if (firstNode.next !== null) { firstNode.next.prev = firstNode; }`: If the first node's next pointer is not nullptr, update its prev pointer to point to the first node.
    
    i. `this.head = firstNode.next;`: Update the head pointer to point to the next node to be processed.
    
    j. `prev = firstNode;`: Update the prev pointer to point to the first node, which is now the second node in the swapped pair.
    
6. `this.head = dummy.next;`: After all pairs have been swapped, update the head of the doubly linked list to the new head by pointing it to the next node of the dummy node.
    
7. `if (this.head) this.head.prev = null;`: Ensure that the prev pointer of the new head node is set to null, as there is no node before the head.
