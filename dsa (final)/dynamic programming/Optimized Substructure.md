**Optimal Substructure**Â is a property of a problem that indicates that an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

In other words, if you can break down a problem into smaller, simpler subproblems, and the best solution to the overall problem can be formed using the best solutions to these subproblems, then the problem exhibits optimal substructure. 

This property is essential for the application of dynamic programming techniques.

e.g. Shortest Path Problem, Knapsack Problem
