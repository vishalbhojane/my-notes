```js
function sortStack(stack) {
  // Initialize an additional stack to help in sorting. This stack
  // will store elements in sorted order.
  const additionalStack = new Stack();

  // Continue the process until the original stack is empty.
  // This loop sorts the stack one element at a time.
  while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
    // Pop the top element from the original stack. This element
    // is the one we're currently trying to place in the correct
    // position in the sorted stack.
    const temp = stack.pop();

    // If the additional stack is not empty and its top element is
    // greater than the element we just popped (temp), we need to
    // move the top element of additionalStack back to the original
    // stack. This loop continues until we find the correct position
    // for temp in the additional stack.
    while (!additionalStack.isEmpty() && additionalStack.peek() > temp) {
      // Pop from additionalStack and push onto the original stack.
      // This step effectively reverses the order of elements that
      // are larger than temp, ensuring they can be sorted later.
      stack.push(additionalStack.pop());
    }

    // Push the temp value into the additionalStack. Now, temp is in
    // the correct position relative to the already sorted elements
    // in additionalStack.
    additionalStack.push(temp);
  }

  // At this point, all elements from the original stack have been
  // moved to additionalStack in sorted order. We now need to move
  // them back to the original stack to maintain the stack order
  // (LIFO - Last In First Out).
  while (!additionalStack.isEmpty()) {
    // Pop from additionalStack and push onto the original stack.
    // This reverses the sorted order back to the original stack,
    // maintaining the sorted sequence.
    stack.push(additionalStack.pop());
  }
