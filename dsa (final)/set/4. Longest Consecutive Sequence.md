```js
// input
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// output - In this example, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 form a consecutive sequence, and the length is 5.
5

// input
[1, 3, 5, 2, 4]
// output - Here, even though the numbers are not in order, they still form a consecutive sequence when arranged. So the length is 5.
5

// inpput
[2, 1, 4, 7, 3]
// output - when arranged in order, the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a consecutive sequence. So, the length is 4.
4

// input 
[9, 1, 3, 10, 2, 20, 21]
// output - the longest consecutive sequence is 9 and 10, or 20 and 21, both having a length of 2
2

// input
[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
// output - the longest consecutive sequence is 1, 2, 3, and 4. The length is 4
4

// input 
[]
// output - the list is empty. Therefore, the length of the longest consecutive sequence is 0.
