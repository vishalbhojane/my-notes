GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them
A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common prime factors

## Solution

```javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
    a = Math.abs(a);
    b = Math.abs(b);
    
    while (b !== 0) {
        let temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    
    return a;
}
```

Core Logic:
1. Make both input numbers positive using Math.abs().
2. Use a while loop that continues as long as b is not zero.
3. In each iteration:
   - Store the current value of b in a temporary variable.
   - Update b to be the remainder of a divided by b.
   - Set a to the temporary value (previous b).
4. When b becomes 0, a will hold the GCD.

Usage:

```javascript
console.log(gcd(48, 18));  // Output: 6
console.log(gcd(100, 75)); // Output: 25
```

## Complexity

Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))). The number of steps is proportional to the logarithm of the smaller number.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

## Explanation

The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the smaller number is subtracted from the larger number. This is optimized by using the modulo operation instead of repeated subtraction.

The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. At this point, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.
