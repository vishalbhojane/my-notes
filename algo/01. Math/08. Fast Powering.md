The power of a number says how many times to use the number in a multiplication.
## Solution

```javascript
function fastPower(base, power) {
    if (power === 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    
    if (power % 2 === 0) {
        const multiplier = fastPower(base, power / 2);
        return multiplier * multiplier;
    } else {
        const multiplier = fastPower(base, Math.floor(power / 2));
        return multiplier * multiplier * base;
    }
}
```

Core Logic:
1. Base case: If power is 0, return 1.
2. If power is even, recursively calculate base^(power/2) and square the result.
3. If power is odd, recursively calculate base^(power//2), square it, and multiply by base.

Usage:

```javascript
console.log(fastPower(2, 10));  // Output: 1024
console.log(fastPower(3, 5));   // Output: 243
```

## Complexity

Time Complexity: O(log(n)), where n is the power. Each recursive call halves the power.

Space Complexity: O(log(n)) due to the recursive call stack.

## Explanation

The Fast Power Algorithm uses the divide and conquer approach to efficiently compute powers. It's based on two key observations:

1. For even powers: x^y = (x^(y/2))^2
2. For odd powers: x^y = x * (x^(y//2))^2
